Numerical Linear Algebra

It includes scripts for solving sets of linear equations.
Lower triangular and upper triangular matrix method for example.

It also has iterative methods like Gauss-Seidel or gradient based methods.

There is also a fast fourier transformation algorithm.

In "Laboratoria" you can find the task definition that correspodn to the appropriately called script like "lab3_zad2".
